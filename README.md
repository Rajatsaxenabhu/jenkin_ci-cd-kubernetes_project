Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

    A Java application codebase hosted on a Git repository
    A Jenkins server set up and accessible
    A Kubernetes cluster running
    The Helm package manager installed
    Argo CD installed and configured

Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up the CI/CD pipeline:
1. Install the Necessary Jenkins Plugins

In Jenkins, navigate to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins, and install the following plugins:

    Git plugin
    Maven Integration plugin
    Pipeline plugin
    Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin

2. Create a New Jenkins Pipeline

    In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job.
    Configure the pipeline with the Git repository URL for the Java application.
    Add a Jenkinsfile to the Git repository to define the pipeline stages.

3. Define the Pipeline Stages

    Checkout: Check out the source code from Git.
    Build: Build the Java application using Maven.
    Test: Run unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.
    SonarQube Analysis: Perform a code quality check.
    Package: Package the application into a JAR file.
    Deploy: Deploy the application to a test environment using Helm.
    User Acceptance Testing: Run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.
    Promote: Promote the application to a production environment using Argo CD.

4. Configure Jenkins Pipeline Stages

   Stage 1: Use the Git plugin to check out the source code from the Git repository.
   Stage 2: Use the Maven Integration plugin to build the Java application.
   Stage 3: Use JUnit and Mockito to run unit tests.
   Stage 4: Use the SonarQube plugin for code quality analysis.
   Stage 5: Package the application using Maven.
   Stage 6: Deploy using the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin with Helm.
   Stage 7: Use a testing framework like Selenium for user acceptance tests.
   Stage 8: Use Argo CD for production deployment.

Setting Up Argo CD

    Install Argo CD on your Kubernetes cluster.
    Set up a Git repository for Argo CD to track changes in the Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests.
    Create a Helm chart for the Java application that includes Kubernetes manifests and Helm values.
    Add the Helm chart to the Git repository tracked by Argo CD.

Running the Pipeline

    Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI/CD process for the Java application.
    Monitor the pipeline stages in Jenkins and resolve any issues that arise.

Troubleshooting

    Build Failures: Check Jenkins logs for errors and ensure all dependencies are properly configured.
    Test Failures: Review failed test cases for bugs or issues introduced in code.
    Deployment Issues: Verify deployment configurations and Argo CD settings.
