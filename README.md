## CI/CD Pipeline for Java Application

This project outlines the setup of an end-to-end Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Java application using Jenkins, SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm, and Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Java application codebase hosted on a Git repository.
- A Jenkins server set up and accessible.
- A Kubernetes cluster running.
- The Helm package manager installed.
- Argo CD installed and configured.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up the CI/CD pipeline:

### 1. Install the Necessary Jenkins Plugins

In Jenkins, navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**, and install the following plugins:

- Git plugin
- Maven Integration plugin
- Pipeline plugin
- Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin

### 2. Create a New Jenkins Pipeline

1. In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job.
2. Configure the pipeline with the Git repository URL for the Java application.
3. Add a `Jenkinsfile` to the Git repository to define the pipeline stages.

### 3. Define the Pipeline Stages

- **Checkout**: Check out the source code from Git.
- **Build**: Build the Java application using Maven.
- **Test**: Run unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.
- **SonarQube Analysis**: Perform a code quality check.
- **Package**: Package the application into a JAR file.
- **Deploy**: Deploy the application to a test environment using Helm.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.
- **Promote**: Promote the application to a production environment using Argo CD.

### 4. Configure Jenkins Pipeline Stages

- **Stage 1**: Use the Git plugin to check out the source code from the Git repository.
- **Stage 2**: Use the Maven Integration plugin to build the Java application.
- **Stage 3**: Use JUnit and Mockito to run unit tests.
- **Stage 4**: Use the SonarQube plugin for code quality analysis.
- **Stage 5**: Package the application using Maven.
- **Stage 6**: Deploy using the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin with Helm.
- **Stage 7**: Use a testing framework like Selenium for user acceptance tests.
- **Stage 8**: Use Argo CD for production deployment.

## Setting Up Argo CD

1. Install Argo CD on your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Set up a Git repository for Argo CD to track changes in the Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests.
3. Create a Helm chart for the Java application that includes Kubernetes manifests and Helm values.
4. Add the Helm chart to the Git repository tracked by Argo CD.

## Running the Pipeline

1. Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI/CD process for the Java application.
2. Monitor the pipeline stages in Jenkins and resolve any issues that arise.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Failures**: Check Jenkins logs for errors and ensure all dependencies are properly configured.
- **Test Failures**: Review failed test cases for bugs or issues introduced in code.
- **Deployment Issues**: Verify deployment configurations and Argo CD settings.
